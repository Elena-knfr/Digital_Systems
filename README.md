# Verilog
This repository contains verilog codes for second-year digital systems course, ECE241.
Codes are compiled and validated using Quartus Prime and use of tcl script.

# How to use?
To use the codes, you need Quartus Prime installed and a DE1-SoC FPGA board by Altera (or a fake FPGA, e.x. DESim GUI). When you installed Quartus, open it and create the project by clicking on "New Project Wizard". Then, add the required files from a  and set the device to 5CSEMA5F31C6. Then, load the pin configuration file, DE1_SoC.qsf. Finally, compile and load the project to the board.

Note: Provided codes are just for reference. Please do not use this for your own course.
